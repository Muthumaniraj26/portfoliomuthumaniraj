**Plant Disease Detection**
  This project is a web application that detects plant diseases in real-time 
  and provides multilingual prevention tips. I was responsible for building 
  the backend API using Python and Flask, integrating the TensorFlow Lite model 
  for inference, and generating dynamic reports.

  ### Core Features
  - Real-time disease detection via live video and image uploads.
  - Interactive charts showing confidence levels of predictions.
  - Heatmap visualization for affected areas on leaves.
  - Multilingual PDF reports with prevention tips.
  - Text-to-speech support for accessibility.
  - QR code generation for easy sharing of results.

  The goal of this project was to create an intuitive and powerful dashboard 
  for farmers and plant enthusiasts to quickly detect diseases and take 
  preventive actions.
