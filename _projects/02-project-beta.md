**Driver Distraction Detection**

  This project detects distracted driving behaviors using live or recorded video feeds. 
  I implemented the detection pipeline and alert system, integrating a YOLOv8-based model 
  for high-accuracy predictions.

  ### Core Features
  - Real-time distraction detection (phone use, yawning, looking away, etc.).
  - Works with both live camera feed and video files.
  - Alert system with visual and audio warnings.
  - Efficient detection pipeline using YOLOv8 for fast processing.
  - Integration with GUI for monitoring and logging alerts.

  The goal of this project was to enhance road safety by providing immediate alerts 
  to drivers showing distracted behavior.
