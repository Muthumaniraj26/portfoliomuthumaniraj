**Emotional detection**
This project analyzes facial expressions in real time and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more using deep learning and image processing techniques. 

I am currently focusing on:  
- Model selection and training.  
- Real-time video feed integration.  
- Dataset preprocessing and annotation.  

Future updates will include performance enhancements, UI improvements, multi-face detection, and emotion trend analysis.

The goal of this project is to create an intuitive and accurate system for real-time emotion recognition that can be applied in research, education, and interactive applications.
