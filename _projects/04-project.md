**Face Recognition Attendance System**

This system automates attendance tracking by recognizing student faces in real-time. I built the face registration, embedding extraction, and recognition pipeline, along with GUI interfaces for monitoring and managing the system.

### Core Features
- Real-time face recognition using 128D embeddings.
- Student in/out time tracking with centroid-based re-identification.
- Fraud detection to prevent photo-based spoofing.
- GUI for face registration, saving datasets, and monitoring attendance.
- Logs and alerts for missing or unregistered faces.

The goal of this project was to streamline attendance management, reduce manual effort, and ensure accuracy and security in classrooms.
