**Automatic LinkedIn Post Generator**

This project automates the creation and posting of LinkedIn content using a **no-code workflow**. It integrates the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for context-aware content generation, **Pipedream** for backend automation, and **Cursor Tools** for browser automation to simulate posting.

I am currently focusing on:  
- Building context-based workflows with MCP.  
- Integrating Pipedream with LinkedIn APIs.  
- Automating posting using Cursor Tools.  

Future updates will include advanced scheduling, multi-account support, and analytics for post performance.

The goal of this project is to help individuals and teams **scale LinkedIn content distribution** efficiently while minimizing manual effort.
