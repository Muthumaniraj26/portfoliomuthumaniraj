**Automatic Email Sender**

This project automates sending professional emails using AI and a no-code workflow. Users only need to input the sender and receiver email addresses along with a real-life scenario (e.g., delay notice, follow-up), and the system will generate and send the email automatically.

I am currently focusing on:  
- Detecting email context using MCP (Model Context Protocol).  
- Automating backend workflows with Pipedream.  
- Simulating email sending via Cursor Tools.  
- Generating AI-powered professional email content with OpenAI.  

Future updates will include multi-account support, scheduling, and advanced templates for business communication.

The goal of this project is to help **freelancers, startups, and teams** automate client emails, notifications, and follow-ups, improving productivity while reducing manual effort.
