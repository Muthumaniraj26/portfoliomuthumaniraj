**"Web-based AI chatbot**

This project is a **web-based AI chatbot** system that provides real-time responses using the Gemini API. It integrates seamlessly with a website interface and leverages MCP and Pipedream for modular and scalable automation.

I am currently focusing on:  
- Building a web interface for AI chat interaction.  
- Real-time conversational responses via Gemini API.  
- Serverless integration and workflow automation using Pipedream.  
- Smart context handling and tool access management with MCP.  
- YouTube video search and embedding for enhanced responses.  

Future updates will include multi-user support, advanced context memory, and additional integration with productivity tools.

The goal of this project is to provide a **modular, scalable AI assistant** that can be used for customer support, content recommendation, or general AI conversational applications.
