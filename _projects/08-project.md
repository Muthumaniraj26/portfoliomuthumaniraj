**AI Archaeologist** 

This is a full-stack web application that goes beyond simple image classification to provide **rich, multi-layered analysis of historical artifacts**. Upload a photo of an artifact, and the system predicts what it is, its era, material, significance, and even nearby archaeological sites.

I am currently focusing on:  
- Artifact classification using a **fine-tuned EfficientNetV2** model trained on 9 South Asian artifact classes (alloy, bead jewellery, blackstone, Kendi, Thakli, hunting tool, pottery, shell bangle, vatta_sillu).  
- Contextual enrichment using a knowledge base to provide detailed historical and cultural context.  
- Time & space calculations: **Carbon-14 dating** + geospatial awareness with the Haversine formula to show nearby sites.  
- Automated PDF report generation with images, charts, and contextual information.  

Future updates will include enhanced multi-artifact support, improved contextual descriptions, and interactive visualizations.

The goal of this project is to **augment human expertise**, making archaeology more accessible and bridging the gap between AI predictions and historical understanding.
