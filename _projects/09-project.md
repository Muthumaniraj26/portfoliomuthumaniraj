**ML Launchpad** 

This is an AI-powered project guide that helps users validate their **machine learning project ideas** and 
automatically generate structured project roadmaps with model recommendations, dataset suggestions, and expected performance metrics.

I am currently focusing on:  
- Integrating **Hugging Face** to analyze project ideas and suggest optimal models.  
- Generating system requirement specifications and complexity scores.  
- Predicting expected accuracy, development timelines, and roadmap steps.  
- Providing dataset links and algorithm suggestions tailored to the user’s project.  

Future updates will include integration with **Google Colab and GitHub Actions** for instant notebook generation and workflow automation.

The goal of this project is to **bridge the gap between idea and execution** — giving students, researchers, and developers a **smart ML mentor** that saves time, provides direction, and accelerates innovation.
